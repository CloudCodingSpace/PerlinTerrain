# PerlinTerrain
This is a test project which I made to play around with perlin noise for terrain generation.
Please excuse me since I can't gurantee that the buildsystem is cross-platform (It was a test project so I didn't intetgrate a proper cross-platform buildsystem).

# Development environment
The platform I am using :-
 - Windows 10, 64-bit 
 - MinGW-W64 14.1.0
 - Buildsystem is Make

The language I am using is C and am rendering using OpenGL and GLFW. For perlin noise algorithm, 
I am using stb_perlin since it is quite a popular single header library.
